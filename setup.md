I suppose the first thing on every potential programmer's mind is how to set
things up. What do you need?

## Tools

Many people use full-fledged IDEs (integrated development environments) like
Visual Studio or Eclipse. Those can be nice if you're working with the
Microsoft stack or Java. But if you're just starting out and not working on
something that will require a lot of refactoring or teamwork, you'll probably
be better off working with a good text editor.

I prefer [Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) (use
[MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads) on OS X). Others
prefer [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) (Mac only). A few more go with gedit, and
some masochists go with nano or Notepad. Pick your poison, but the real
advantages of Vim and Emacs are that they have a bunch of keybindings
(shortcuts) for common programming text-editing issues. TextMate has some
really nice auto-completion features for languages like Ruby.
