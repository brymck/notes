description: Some notes by me on introductory programming
---

Everything here is a work in progress. I thought about making something like
this while teaching my girlfriend some code. I realized, as someone outside the
IT community, that I'm surrounded by people who can't code. It's not that it's
difficult. Sure, a lot of languages are, but you don't need to know how to hack
on the Linux kernel to get some value out of learning what that machine you
interact with daily is doing.

While there's an initial learning curve, from there you receive many benefits.

## Frustration

If I may use my broad brush for a second, I'll declare that the biggest turn-off
for aspiring programmers has to be a bad first impression. What is that first
impression? Well, if you're starting off on web programming it might be PHP. If
it's scripting for productivity suites like Office, it's likely VBA.  If
it's your first computer science course, that would be C or C++. If you just
downloaded the first IDE you heard of for the OS you likely have, Visual Studio,
it might be VB .NET.

C and C++ are wonderfully powerful, but the initial learning curve is steep: you
have to learn all the basics of programming plus things like memory management,
pointers and compilation _all at once_. And it's quite likely that that power
is lost on the beginner trying to learn how to print user input backwards gets
mysterious errors on segfaults and missing semicolons and not enough or too many
asterisks. C++ is great for experienced professionals working in large teams
with other experienced professionals and focused on efficiency.

The other two, PHP and VBA, are just painful in a way that most languages
aren't. We can argue about Perl vs Python vs Ruby until the cows come home, but
it's a debate incapable of resolution: they're all fairly powerful, clean and
friendly. While they (potentially) lack the speed of lower-level languages like
C, there is very little a novice needs to do that demands optimization.

And then there's VB .NET, whose syntax is deceptively simple. [It's really the
stuff of rants.][vb_rant]
