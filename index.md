description: Some notes by me on introductory programming

Everything here is a work in progress. I thought about making something like this
while teaching my girlfriend some code. I realized, as someone outside the IT
community, that I'm surrounded by people who can't code. It's not that it's difficult.
Sure, a lot of languages are, but you don't need to know how to hack on the Linux
kernel to get some value out of scripting.

While there's an initial learning curve, from there you receive many benefits.
